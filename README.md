Hey there, I'm Dylan. Here on my GitHub you'll find all my hobbyist projects that I develop. Almost none of my work is done here, so feel free to reach out directly if you're interested in that.

I primarily dabble in React (JS/TS), but you'll also find a lot of node scripts and some of my older Python scripts in here as well.
